## Project Overview
Millions of people, especially in low-resource settings, struggle to access timely and reliable medical guidance due to **language barriers**, **lack of internet connectivity,** and **limited access to smart devices**. In emergencies and routine health queries alike, users need immediate, understandable, and trustworthy advice that traditional systems often fail to provide.

- Globally, over **3.7 billion people still do not have internet access** (ITU estimates).
- In India, despite rapid digital growth, more than **700 million people remain offline**, limiting access to digital health resources.
- In many low-resource settings, the **shortage of medical professionals is stark**.
- Approximately 40% of the world's population speaks a language underrepresented online, meaning many **digital health tools aren't available in their native language**. 

## Features

- **Voice-Based AI Assistance**:
Sahayak uses programmable voice to offer a fully voice-activated interface that works even on basic phones, without internet.

- **Multilingual Support**:
Users can select their preferred language (English, Hindi, etc) at the start of the call, ensuring that all communication - including symptom queries and first-aid instructions, is delivered in their language.

- **Integrated Medical Guidance**:
Leveraging the Gemini API , Sahayak provides real-time general medical guidance for symptom-related queries while strictly avoiding diagnoses.

- **Emergency & Direct Connectivity**:
The system not only offers first-aid instructions for common emergencies (e.g., burns, cuts, fever, dehydration) but also connects users directly to doctors or emergency services if needed.

- **Location-Based Services**:
With integrated Google Maps API, Sahayak can quickly find nearby hospitals and clinics and send details (name, address, phone number) via SMS.

- **SMS Support**:
All guidance and details are also sent via SMS, ensuring users have a permanent record of their medical advice - even if they miss the voice call.
